{% quote(author="[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation)") %} In computing, **procedural generation** (sometimes shortened as **proc-gen**) is a method of creating data algorithmically as opposed to manually, typically through a *combination* of *human-generated* assets and algorithms coupled with *computer-generated* randomness and processing power. {% end %}

The art&thinsp;(!) of **procedural generation** is an extremely powerful method to reduce the amount of work needed to create levels and assets.

It's quite common for game engines, frameworks and editors to provide artists with a large variety of proc-gen tools, from basic object placement to generating entire levels/worlds. As such, a ludicrous number of games use procedural generation, in one form or another, for a variety of purposes such as:

- Object Placement
- Level Generation
- Terrain Generation
- Plant/Foliage Generation
- Texture Generation
- Sound Generation
- ...

If we tried listing all the ways proc-gen is used, we'd be here all week!

{% info_notice() %}
Note that procedural generation is **not** limited to just *games*; far from it! It's used basically *anywhere* anyone needs to create *chaos*, *repetition* and large-scale *patterns* without spending days (if not weeks or months!) being bored out of their mind[^boredom].

[^boredom]: This doesn't mean it can't be fun manually doing what procedural generation can do automatically; for some people *being* a procedural generator is a genuine form of relaxation!
