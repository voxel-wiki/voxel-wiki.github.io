In general, (visibility-) culling is the process of limiting the amount of things rendered
(both geometry and drawcalls) to manageable levels, so the GPU doesn't go up in flames.

So, here are ~6 kinds of culling, in no particular order:

1. [Back Face Culling](/wiki/backface-culling): Don't render what is facing away from the camera.
2. [Interior Culling](/wiki/interior-culling): Don't render what is inside of objects.
3. [Distance Culling](/wiki/distance-culling): Don't render what is too far away.
4. [Frustum Culling](/wiki/frustum-culling): Don't render what falls outside the cameras view.
5. [Portal Culling](/wiki/portal-culling): Don't render what is in another room.
6. [Cluster Culling](/wiki/cluster-culling): Don't render what is too small to see.
7. [Occlusion Culling](/wiki/occlusion-culling): Don't render what is hidden.

Optimizing culling is generally done by creating *spatial hierarchies*,
whereby testing nodes on higher levels allows rejecting (or including)
large swathes of the hierarchy, reducing the amount of work to be done.

> **Note:**  
> Directly storing individual primitives/triangles in a spatial hierarchy is extremely inefficient,
> since the geometry must still be loaded/generated, sent to the GPU and be transformed.
