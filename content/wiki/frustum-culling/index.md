> Removal of geometry that is outside the cameras view region.

{{ stub_notice() }}

**Notes:**
- A [view frustum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewing_frustum) is defined as four-plus-two [planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_planes_in_three-dimensional_space) attached to a camera.
  - An inwards facing plane for each edge of the window/viewport.
    - Simply referred to as `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left`.
    - Built from the cameras position and field-of-view.
  - A plane facing into the screen called the `near`-plane, at some close distance `depth_near`/`zNear`.
  - A plane facing the camera called the `far`-plane, at some far distance `depth_far`/`zFar`.
- Pieces of geometry (like meshes and chunks) have *bounding volumes*.
- Generally an *axis-aligned bounding box*, defined as a pair of `min` & `max` 3d vectors, is used.
- A [chunk](/wiki/chunking) of voxels has an *implicit* bounding-box that fully encases it.
- A chunk *may* have an explicit bounding-box encasing *only* the visible voxels.
