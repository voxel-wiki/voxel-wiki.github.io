The [Digital Differential Analyzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_differential_analyzer_(graphics_algorithm)) (`DDA`) algorithm,
adapted to 3D, is *exactly* the thing one needs to travel along a line (or a ray) through a grid of voxels.

## Implementation

The following implementation was written in `GLSL`,
but should be simple enough to be ported to any language one may choose...
