[Voxel.Wiki](https://voxel.wiki/) is a website that is all about [voxels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel): Values on regular grids in three-dimensional space!

This repository holds the contents of the website in the form of a [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) project.

Feel free to contribute! :)

## Contributing

1. Fork the project.
1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME-HERE/voxel-wiki.github.io.git`
1. Open a console/terminal in the cloned projects directory.
1. [Install Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/), such that it is on your `PATH` or put it right in the projects directory.  
   (Zola is a *single* executable file, so there shouldn't be any issues with this. Else, open an issue!)
1. Run `zola serve`.
1. Make your changes to the content.
1. Check the life-preview in your browser.
1. Repeat from 6 as long as you need.
1. Push the changes to your fork.

1. ???
1. PROFIT!

If you're a maintainer (eg: you are part of the `voxel-wiki` organisation), you *may* directly push changes, as long as they don't affect too many pages. In the latter case, it's a better idea to do it trough a pull-request or a separate branch.
